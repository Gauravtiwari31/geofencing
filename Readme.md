# Smart Tourist Safety System üõ°Ô∏èüåç

## Overview

The **Smart Tourist Safety System** is a tech-driven platform designed to enhance tourist security through **blockchain-based digital IDs, geo-fencing, AI-powered anomaly detection, and IoT wearables**.

The solution ensures real-time safety monitoring while respecting privacy and offering a user-friendly experience ‚Äî particularly useful in remote or high-risk regions.

## Key Features üöÄ

### üîê Blockchain Digital ID

* Tourists register at entry points and receive a **tamper-proof digital ID** on a blockchain.
* IDs are verifiable via QR codes/digital certificates.
* Data privacy ensured using decentralized identity management.

### üì± Tourist Mobile Application

* **Safety Score**: Calculates a real-time score based on location, time, and risk factors.
* **Geo-fencing Alerts**: Warns tourists and notifies authorities if entering unsafe zones.
* **SOS Panic Button**: Sends live GPS location & ID to police and emergency contacts.
* **Real-Time Tracking (Opt-in)**: Families or authorities can follow tourist location (with consent).
* **Multilingual & Accessible**: Support for multiple Indian languages, voice commands, and accessibility features.

### ü§ñ AI Anomaly Detection

* Detects unusual patterns like:

  * Prolonged inactivity.
  * Sudden falls or sharp altitude changes.
  * Deviations from planned itinerary.
* Auto-generates alerts and missing person reports (E-FIR simulation).

### üñ•Ô∏è Tourism & Police Dashboard

* Real-time map with tourist locations & safety status.
* Incident/alert management (SOS, geofence, AI triggers).
* Tourist profile verification via blockchain.
* High-risk zone updates, broadcast messaging, and analytics.

### ‚åö IoT Wearables (ESP32 Prototype)

* Smart band with **SOS button, motion & health sensors**.
* Streams real-time vitals and auto-triggers alerts for anomalies.
* Works alongside the mobile app for enhanced safety.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

* **Blockchain**: Hyperledger Fabric / Ethereum (for MVP).
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express / Python (FastAPI/Flask) for APIs & AI services.
* **Database**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (geo-queries), MongoDB (logs).
* **Mobile App**: Flutter (cross-platform) or Native Android (Kotlin).
* **Dashboard**: React + Leaflet/Google Maps API.
* **IoT Devices**: ESP32 (C++/Arduino IDE or MicroPython).

* AI anomaly detection (rule-based).
* IoT SOS wearable integration.
* Dashboard with real-time map & heatmaps.

**Phase 3: Pilot Deployment**

* Full blockchain integration.
* Advanced AI models for predictive safety.
* Family/friends live tracking portal.
* Production-grade IoT hardware & emergency service integration.
